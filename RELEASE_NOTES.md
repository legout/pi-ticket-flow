# Unreleased

# pi-ticket-flow v0.4.2

This patch release adds Diátaxis-style documentation and clarifies delegated prompt behavior.

## Highlights

- Added short tutorial, how-to, reference, and explanation docs under `docs/`
- Documented delegated prompt frontmatter behavior for `subagent:` prompts, including model, thinking, skill, loop, rotate, fresh, and related fields
- Linked the docs from the root README and included them in the published package

# pi-ticket-flow v0.4.1

This patch release tightens ticket-flow reliability and tunes a few model/runtime defaults.

## Highlights

- Fixed ticket-flow artifact handoff so implementation, validation, and review each use distinct per-run artifact paths
- Stopped validation from trying to overwrite implementation artifacts across fresh subagent sessions
- Updated review/finalization stages to read validation state explicitly, preventing stale artifact reads and repeated validation behavior
- Tuned prompt model selections for planning, review, and validation flows
- Increased the `/review-fix-chain` retry budget and documented `ty check` in the generic test-fix guidance

## Ticket-flow reliability

- `ticket-pick` now creates per-run `implementation`, `validation`, and `review` artifact paths
- `ticket-test-fix` now writes a dedicated validation artifact instead of mutating the implementation artifact
- `ticket-mark-review`, `ticket-review`, deep ticket review prompts, and `ticket-finalize` now consume the validation artifact explicitly
- Main-session orchestration remains the owner of `ticket-flow/current.md` state transitions

# pi-ticket-flow v0.4.0

Planning and review got sharper, ticketization got smarter, and the ticket workflow now cleanly separates implementation from validation.

## Highlights

- Reworked `/review` and `/review-deep` around the base reviewer agent, including parallel multi-lens deep review with final consolidation
- Made generic review, refactor, and simplify prompts start fresh and added explicit scope guardrails to avoid biased or invented context
- Upgraded ExecPlan authoring and improvement guidance to prefer independently verifiable vertical slices with explicit prerequisites, related work, and conflict boundaries
- Upgraded `/ticketize` to produce dependency-aware tickets with scheduling hints such as `Kind`, `Related to`, `Conflicts with`, `Parallel-safe with`, and suggested worktree isolation
- Clarified the ticket workflow split so `ticket-implement` only implements and leaves all validation/fix-to-green work to `ticket-test-fix`

## Workflow changes

- `/ticket-flow` and `/ticket-queue` now follow the full chain: `ticket-pick → ticket-implement → ticket-test-fix → ticket-mark-review → ticket-review → ticket-finalize`
- Ticket implementation artifacts now defer validation evidence to the dedicated validation step instead of mixing the two responsibilities
- Ticket review continues to run only after validation has completed and the artifact is `ready-for-review`

## Planning and ticketization

- ExecPlans now encourage vertical milestones by default and reserve horizontal milestones for explicit enablers, migrations, prototypes, or cleanup
- Milestone prose now captures true prerequisites, soft links, parallel-safe slices, and serialization/conflict points for later ticketization
- `ticketize` now prefers a dependency DAG over mechanical milestone-order chaining and reports ticket kind plus important scheduling hints

## Review prompt redesign

- Replaced `/review` with a simple single-review prompt using the base `reviewer` agent
- Replaced `/review-deep` Best-of-N review with parallel review passes plus a final consolidation step
- Replaced `/ticket-review-deep` Best-of-N review with parallel ticket-review passes plus a final consolidation step that writes the canonical ticket review artifact
- Removed the obsolete internal `/review-single` alias and updated `/review-fix-chain` to use `/review` directly

# pi-ticket-flow v0.3.0

Prompt consolidation — fewer files, same functionality, better use of pi chain/loop features.

## Highlights

- Consolidated 24 prompts down to 19 by removing duplicates and merging queue-specific variants
- Simplified orchestrator prompts (`/plan`, `/plan-and-build`) to use `chain:` frontmatter instead of inlined multi-step instructions
- Merged `ticket-pick`/`ticket-queue-pick` and `ticket-finalize`/`ticket-queue-finalize` — the merged versions auto-detect queue context via `progress.md` existence
- Both `/ticket-flow` and `/ticket-queue` now share the exact same chain: `ticket-pick → ticket-implement → ticket-mark-review → ticket-review → ticket-finalize`

## Removed commands

These were duplicates or inlined copies of existing chains:

- `/ticket-flow-chain` — identical to `/ticket-flow`
- `/ticket-step` — identical to `/ticket-direct`
- `/ticket-direct` — inlined copy of the `/ticket-flow` chain
- `/ticket-queue-pick` — merged into `/ticket-pick`
- `/ticket-queue-finalize` — merged into `/ticket-finalize`

## Simplified commands

- `/plan` — now delegates to `/plan-chain` instead of inlining the architect/create/improve steps
- `/plan-and-build` — now a pure chain: `plan → ticketize → ticket-queue` (was 30 lines of procedural orchestration, now 7 lines)

## Commands (complete list)

### Planning
- `/ticket-flow-init` — scaffold project guidance files
- `/brainstorm <topic>` — interactive brainstorming
- `/architect <topic>` — create/update ARCHITECTURE.md
- `/plan <topic>` — full pipeline: brainstorm → plan-chain
- `/plan-chain <topic>` — chain: architect → plan-create → plan-improve
- `/plan-create <topic>` — create ExecPlan
- `/plan-improve <topic>` — deep-audit ExecPlan (loops up to 3×)
- `/ticketize <topic>` — ExecPlan → tk tickets
- `/plan-and-build <topic>` — chain: plan → ticketize → ticket-queue

### Execution
- `/ticket-flow` — chain: pick → implement → review → finalize (one ticket)
- `/ticket-queue` — chain with loop: pick → implement → review → finalize (until queue empty)
- `/ticket-reset` — clear stale orchestrator state
- `/bridge-smoke` — verify delegated execution works

### Maintenance
- `/update-architecture <topic>` — sync ARCHITECTURE.md post-implementation
